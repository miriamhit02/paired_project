# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.*

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
  * Miriam: Obviously, I want to learn to code properly and efficiently. Most importantly, I want to learn how to work together on projects in an online setting (and do it well).
  * Lex: I like those ideas and goals and also share them!
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  * Miriam: I like the idea of working together, especially because we are just starting. Perhaps two minds work better than one! I like that we already had an individual project to work on our skills, but I feel like I still need some help in places.
  * Lex: I also like the idea of working together, even if my immediate instinct is to divide and conquer. I tend to get stuck and self conscious on problems, and am afraid I would hold the team back in a divide and conquer approach, at least with my current skill set.
  * Both: this is going to go well!
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
  * Miriam: If we're working on something and I'm navigating, if I say to do something that you don't think is right, just let me know verbally (immediately but gently and respectfully) if you have another idea.
  * Lex: I prefer immediate verbal feedback in a gentle, kind way especially when we are working together. I am afraid I am a bit of a verbal steamroller, and I would hope that if I do misstep or say something harsh, my partner could raise their hand and say, "Hey, pause, something happened and I feel this way about it..." and then move on. Verbal communication works best for me, but I do get easily distracted.  
* How would you describe your work style?
  * Miriam: In general, when I'm trying to work on something I have to be away from distraction but have a little background noise (like music or a fan). In groups, I try to be an active communicator. I like to be having a constant conversation about what we are all on the same page. I feel like I need a little more experience doing this, though, before I know exactly what to say here.
  * Lex: I tend to be a but dominant in group work settings and will tend to take over things, if I do not keep myself in check. In previous group projects, I would feel the need to take control of whatever was going on if I thought I had a better way of doing it, and I recognize that this was not good for my work or anybody else's. I am a little shy about sharing things until I am confident that they will look perfect, but actively working together helps keep this behavior in check and improve the quality of the group work. Also, if I do not communicate regularly, I am probably procrastinating. Also, please let me know when I interrupt... I feel like I am pretty bad about it.  
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
  * Miriam: I am great at identifying other people's strengths but struggle when trying to identify my own. However, I have heard that I am creative, determined, dedicated, and good at operating within a diverse community. I have also heard that I am kind to others. My partner in this project tells me I am very considerate of others needs, and proactive about finding ways to work harmoniously. Additionally, we are already finding creative ways to address bumps in the road without losing sight of our goals and while continuing to make progress.
  * Lex: I am also good at pointing out other people's strengths and bringing awareness to how those strengths are valuable and useful both in and outside of a group. I feel that this helps group dynamics by making projects feel more collaborative and inclusive. I am cautious but also willing to play and make many mistakes, and find that learning and creativity are fostered in an environment of safety where "play" is possible. I do have a critical and mostly thorough mind which helps identify potential pain points.
  * Both: We're both good communicators and try hard to be respectful and kind while also striving for accuracy and good output. This is going to go well! We have high hopes.
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  * Lex: I procrastinate, panic, and sometimes in the absence of others to whom to be accountable, but not intimidated by, I freeze up. This happened in my last individual project and it led to predictable failure. However, I am proud that even when I know something is broken or wrong with my code, I can move past the error and onto the next problem and at least get to the end of whatever I was working on, even if the finished project isn't pretty.
  * Miriam: I have procrastinated a bit, not to the extent that I failed the project, but it did cause a lot of stress which could have been avoided. I will freak out and panic at problems, sometimes, but what is going well is that toward the end of the last project, I was learning to calm down and analyze the problem and try to figure it out with an open mind.  
  * Both: Just had a great win from asking for help with a git issue. That wasn't so bad!
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
  * We both seem to be pretty good at compromising - patiently listening to each person's idea, giving feedback on the ideas, and repeating the process until a conclusion has been made between both parties.
* How will we overcome obstacles?
  * First, we need to figure out what the heck is going on or what is causing the issue. First, give ourselves a bit of time to figure it out, but reach out for help after struggling with the problem for 15-20 minutes.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
  * Miriam: I need a room without distractions (people talking, doing loud things etc, or random loud noises). As far as communication, I need regular communication (as in daily at the barest minimum). I need a good internet connection, a good search engine, my brother, instructors, and mentors to whom to reach out.
  * Lex: I need a good internet connection, my own battle station (work station), the ability to go outside for pom breaks, snacks, water, and the occasional break to vape. Regarding communication, I prefer to communicate multiple times per day, if possible, combining slack and Zoom (especially working in a group!).
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  * Miriam: Church every day at 7PM EST running until about 9PM EST Monday through Saturday - I never skip this. Church and family time on Sundays is from 10AM-3PM and sometimes goes a little later. I value my morning routine, as well. Any time after class and before church is a good time to work on projects. This Saturday I have an event for church which will take a significant chunk of the day, but the afternoon should be free.
  * Lex: mornings are important to me - for right now I would like to avoid working before class, but communicating before class would probably be fine. I prefer not to work on school before 7AM MST and after 9PM MST. Also I might need a random nap for migraine management.
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  * Miriam: I, by nature, can't stand hurting other people's feelings. I try to be kind about it, but also professional. I will speak up and be assertive but will try my best not to hurt feelings.
  * Lex: I value immediacy in feedback, and I often send feedback in multiple communication channels (sometimes at once) and hope that this is not overwhelming. I try to be kind, but sometimes shorter sentences are read as more severe than I intend... I try to use emojis to convey a softer tone of voice.
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
  *
  *
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
  * Slack, Zoom, Atom, Github, potentially text messages, and anything else we find from class in the upcoming week. Also cohort mates/mentors/instructors/stackoverflow/etc are essential external resources! Spellcheck also seems to be a must.   
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  * (see overcoming obstacles)
  * When in doubt, reach out! Slack and community Zoom rooms should be leveraged (we might need to make them ourselves)
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
  * When requirements identified in the instructions are met, that is a success!
  * Overcoming an obstacle, no matter how small, is a major success! Celebrate small victories, here.
  * It's better to have the project complete, but not pretty, than incomplete and partially "perfect"
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
  * Verbally!!! Enthusiastically!! Immediately if it's not too disruptive!!

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
